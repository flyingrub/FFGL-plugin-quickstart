# FFGL Plugin quickstart
This repository is intended to be a little framework around the FFGL SDK. It takes care of all the boring stuff and let you focus on what you really want to do : be creative.

### How do I use this ?
Everything you need to know to start to write your own plugin can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/flyingrub/FFGL-plugin-quickstart/wiki) of this repo.
